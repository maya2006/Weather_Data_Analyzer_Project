# Weather_Data_Analyzer_Project

🌦 Project Title: Weather Data Analyzer

📝 Project Overview

The Weather Data Analyzer is a Python-based data science mini project that analyzes historical weather data to identify trends, visualize patterns, and predict future temperatures using a simple Machine Learning algorithm. The project is built as part of Arttifai Tech's internship requirement and focuses on transforming raw weather data into meaningful visual insights.

📁 Project Structure

File	Description

weather_analyzer.py	Main Python script that performs analysis, visualization, and prediction
weather_data.csv	Input dataset containing weather data
temperature_trend.png	Line chart of temperature over the years
rainfall_distribution.png	Bar graph showing rainfall per year
humidity_vs_temperature.png	Scatter plot between humidity and temperature
temperature_prediction.png	Linear Regression prediction graph
(Optional) README.md	Project documentation file (this!)

📊 Visualizations Done

Line Chart: Shows how temperature has changed over time (temperature_trend.png)

Bar Graph: Displays rainfall distribution per year (rainfall_distribution.png)

Scatter Plot: Plots humidity vs temperature to observe correlation (humidity_vs_temperature.png)

Prediction Chart: Uses Linear Regression to forecast future temperature (temperature_prediction.png)

🧠 Machine Learning Used

Model Used: LinearRegression from scikit-learn

Goal: Predict temperature based on years

Model Evaluation Metrics:

Mean Squared Error (MSE)

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)


These values are printed in the terminal as part of model evaluation.

🛠 Technologies Used

Python 3.13.3

VS Code (Visual Studio Code) as the IDE

Libraries:

pandas – data analysis

matplotlib – charting

seaborn – advanced plotting

numpy – numeric operations

scikit-learn – linear regression model
