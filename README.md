🌦 Project Title: Weather Data Analyzer


---

📝 Project Overview

The Weather Data Analyzer is a Python-based data science mini project that analyzes historical weather data to identify trends, visualize patterns, and predict future temperatures using a simple Machine Learning algorithm. The project is built as part of Arttifai Tech's internship requirement and focuses on transforming raw weather data into meaningful visual insights.

🎯 Key Objectives

1. Visualize weather patterns such as temperature, rainfall, and humidity over time.


2. Discover relationships between humidity and temperature.


3. Forecast future temperature trends using Linear Regression.


4. Save all visual outputs as .png files for easy reference and documentation.
